When writing code in controllers, you may sometimes wonder for a piece of code to generate random number,

You can override 2 function:

```php
 public function BeforeInitialize()
{
    // you can take action before real function executed here
}

public function AfterInitialize()
{
    // you can take action after real function executed here
}
```
